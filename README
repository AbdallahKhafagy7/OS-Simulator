# Operating System Scheduling & Memory Simulator

This project is a university-level Operating System simulator implemented in **C**.
It demonstrates CPU scheduling, process lifecycle management, and paging-based memory management (for Round Robin scheduling) in a simulated environment, including **Second Chance** and **LRU** page replacement algorithms.

## Features & Contributions

* **CPU Scheduling Algorithms:**

  * Highest Priority First (HPF) with dependency handling
  * Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
  * Round Robin (RR) with paging-based memory management (Second Chance & LRU)

* **Process Lifecycle Management:**

  * Handles process states: New, Ready, Running, Blocked, Finished
  * Context switching and preemption logic
  * Process arrival and termination handling

* **Enhancements Added:**

  * Improved project documentation and setup instructions
  * Added usage examples
  * Cleaned up code structure and file organization

---

## Build & Run Instructions

The project uses a **Makefile** for building and running.

### 1. Build the project

```bash
make build
```

This will:

* Clean old builds and temporary files
* Compile all source files into the corresponding executables

### 2. Run the simulator

```bash
make run
```

This will:

* Generate test data
* Run the process generator to create `processes.txt`
* Run the scheduler simulation

### 3. Clean up generated files

```bash
make clean
```

Removes all `.out`, `.txt`, `.log`, `.perf`, and object files.

## Output Files

* `scheduler.log` → Logs scheduler execution details
* `memory.log` → Logs memory management operations
* `scheduler.perf` → Stores performance statistics

---

## Executables

* `process_generator.out` → Generates the process data file
* `clk.out` → Simulates the system clock
* `scheduler.out` → Runs the scheduling simulation
* `test_generator.out` → Runs tests for the system
* `process.out` → Auxiliary executable for process operations

---

## Technologies Used

* C
* Makefile for build automation
* Linux environment
* Data structures: queues and priority queues
* OS concepts: CPU scheduling (HPF with dependencies, SRTN, RR with Second Chance & LRU), process management, memory management

---

## Summary

This project demonstrates my ability to implement core OS algorithms in C, manage processes and memory using **Second Chance and LRU page replacement** for RR scheduling, and handle **dependencies in HPF scheduling**, along with structuring a multi-file project with automated building and testing.
It also includes logging and performance measurement through `scheduler.log`, `memory.log`, and `scheduler.perf`.
It reflects both understanding of OS fundamentals and professional coding practices in C.
